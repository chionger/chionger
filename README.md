# 👋 Hi, I'm chionger

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a PMP certified Project Manager with a passion about turning ideas into working prototypes — especially in the areas of : 

**
**AI-Assisted Learning**, 
**AI-powered tools**

, and 
**learning-driven development**.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus
- Building interactive **Unity simulations** (e.g., drone control)
- Exploring **voice + AI integration** (Whisper, speech commands, automation)
- Fast-prototyping with **C#**, **Python**, and real-time systems

---

## 📘 Learning Journey
I'm actively documenting:
- "Think → Learn → Build" logs for each prototype
- Explorations of Reinforcement Learning, Agentic AI, and Real-time systems

## 🧠 Project Philosophy
Each repo tells a story:
1. **Why** the project exists
2. **What I learned** from building it
3. **How it connects** to broader AI or simulation concepts
